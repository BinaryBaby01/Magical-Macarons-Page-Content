        <h4>This should be done before the method.</h4>
        <h5>To ease the process.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Get the butter out beforehand so it can warm up to room temperature, it will be easier to work with.</li>

        <h3>Let's get to the Method!‚ú®</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly, chop up the butter into chunks.</li>
                <li>Secondly, sift the flour the into your mixing bowl and add the salt.</li>
                <li>Then, put the bowl in the fridge for a few minutes to chill (keeping ingredients cold is a way of ensuring the butter does not coat the grain making the pastry unable to soak up the water we need to add later) .</li>
                <li>Once we have cold ingredients we can add the butter to the bowl and stir it so that every piece of butter is coated in flour! ‚ù§</li>
                <li>We now need to use our hands and work the pastry a bit with our fingers (this process favours those with cold hands) , you will know it is ready when it has reached a breadcrumb like appearance.</li>
                <li>Now we can add our water, pour 100ml then add 10ml at a time, incorporating with a fork, to form a <em>rough dough.</em></li>
                <li>Then, bring the dough together into a single ball and heavily dust the surface you are working on and your hands in flour.</li>
                <li>turn the dough onto the floured surface and roll the dough into a fat tube, without applying too much pressure wrap it up in cling film and refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>lightly reflour the surface and roll out the pastry until it is about as thick as a ¬£1 coin and 3 times as long as it is wide, keep tossing the pastry as you roll to ensure an even rectangular roll and squish the sides in as necessary.</li>
                <li>Fold the bottom and top third of the pastry in on itself, to make a square block.</li>
                <li>Fold the pastry in half again and press the edges together with the rolling pin.</li>
                <li>Roll out and fold the pastry again, repeating steps 9-11 four times.If the pastry feels greasy at any point, or starts to spring back when as you roll, then cover and chill it for 10 minutes before continuing.</li>
                <li>Chill the finished pastry for atleast an hour, or ideally overnight, before using.</li>
                <li>When you use the pastry roll it out to about the thickness of a ¬£1 coin, and cook it at 200C/400F/Gas 6 for around 30 minutes or until it is golden.</li>
                <li>Serves: 550g puff pastry.</li>
