        <h3>Let's get to the Method!✨</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, chop the ends of your potatoes.(and any roots if you've got them)</li>
            <li>Next,  we are ready to slice them into wedges by cutting along the potatoes vertically slicing approx 1.5cm in thickness.</li>
            <li>Once the potato has been sliced it will need slicing again on the other side to create the perfect wedges.✨</li>
            <li>We now have, wedge like slices, the slices cut from the middle may be a bit too long, cut them in half vertically so that all the wedges are similar sizes and cook through at the same time.❤</li>
            <li>Now we need to let these wedges marinate in some water to soften them up a bit!</li>
            <li>Place all of the potato slices into a mixing bowl and add cold water until they're submerged, add a few pinches of salt and let rest for an hour and a half, at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Once the wedges have rested, they are ready to be drained.</li>
            <li>When the wedges have been drained, they are ready for seasoning , add a few teaspoons of vegetable oil into the mixing bowl the wedges are in.</li>
            <li>This will help the spices stick to our wedges, get out a fork to spin and toss your wedges around in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Adding spices is up to you , i personally love a kick to my wedges, this is how i season :</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of paprika, a teaspoon of chili powder, cayenne pepper powder, and chili flakes.Stir around with a fork (if you let this sit the flavour will seep into the wedges very coresss) </li>
            <li>Seasoning : 2 tablespoons of american bbq seasoning , 1 tablespoon general purpose seasoning and half a teaspoon of garlic granules</li>
            <li>spin and flip the wedges inside of the bowl , with a fork, ensuring to coat each wedge sufficiently.</li>
            <li>Grease your tray, before putting the wedges on it and shake the tray a little to level out the wedges.</li>
            <li>OVEN: place in oven and cook for 30-35 minutes or until browned and crisp.</li>
            <h4 id="portions">This should make 2 portions of wedges! So feel free to share this recipe! Or fridge it and keep it to yourself!</h4>
