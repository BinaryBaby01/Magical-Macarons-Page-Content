        <h3>Let's get to the Method!✨</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, chop the ends of your potatoes.</li>
            <li>Next, chop all the sides down until there is no skin left on the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes flesh is revealed, we are ready to slice them into chips by cutting along the potato vertically, at the desired length of the person preparing them, i personally cut them 1.5cm thick approx.</li>
            <li>We now have, potato slices, the slices cut from the middle may be a bit too long, i recommend cutting them in half vertically so that all the chips are similar sizes and cook through at the same time.❤</li>
            <li>You may think that we're done here, but I assure we are not, Theres still one magic step to making chips!</li>
            <li>Place all of the potato slices into a mixing bowl and add cold water until they're submerged, add a few pinches of salt and let rest for an hour and a half, at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Once the chips have rested, they are ready to be drained and cooked up, there are two methods in which you can cook chips</li>
            <li>OVEN: place in oven and cook for 30-35 minutes or until golden and crisp.</li>
            <li>DEEPFAT FRIER: place the dial on  between 1-2 o'clock. 🕐🕑 whilst the oil is heating up , submerge the chips in the warm oil for a few seconds then place them on the stand again.(this is called blanching and the key to the perfect fried chips)🍟</li>
            <li>Then when the oil is ready submerge the chips again, this time waiting until the chips rise. (TIP:They are ready when you see them all floating in the oil).</li>
            <li>leave to stand for a few minutes before eating and season to your preference.🧂salt, pepper and vinegar for me!</li>
            <li>NOTE:AIR FRIERS are a thing , i just don't have one so can't comment on how to use it to prepare chips</li>
            <h4 id="portions">This should make 2 portions of chips! So feel free to share this recipe!</h4>
